# Chuck Norris API + `fetch()`

Using the Chuck Norris Quote API, we're fetching a quote and rendering on a page.

There are at least 8 errors in this code that are preventing it from working.

_ALL_ of the errors are in the JavaScript. The HTML/CSS is unchanged, and the API urls are correct.

Errors might be, but aren't necessarily limited to:

* Spelling Nemesis
* Missing brackets
* Missing functions/function calls
* Not returning data from a function
* Not selecting/creating DOM elements
